### This folder contains all requied files to run the demonstration of GAUGE analysis on a random set of RNA-seq data, 3 studies in total, processed by refine.bio
### The "downloadedFrom_refineBio_coreScriptDemo.zip" is the output file provided by refine.bio.  For detail folder structure of this file, please visit:

### The zip file compresses the metadata file (aggregated_metadata.json), and 3 expression data files (SRP228531.tsv, SRP055410.tsv, SRP090296.tsv). Those files were unzipped and place at the same directory of the R script.
