#### Even though the core steps of GAUGE, which are Mantel test and sample group assignment, are the same for _Microarray_ and _RNA-seq_ studies, the data wrangling processes are different. Hence, we provide two scripts for microarray studies and RNA-seq studies, respectively. Please browse the corresponding folders to find the script and dependent files for demonstration.
